# PWA Implementation Summary

## Overview
PWA (Progressive Web App) support has been implemented for My Agent Follow v0.1 according to the specifications.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Service Worker (`public/service-worker.js`)
- **Cache Name**: `maf-cache-v2` (as specified in requirements)
- **Features**:
  - Pre-caching of essential files (index.html, manifest.json, icons)
  - Install event: Caches app shell files
  - Activate event: Cleans up old caches
  - Fetch event: Serves cached content when available, falls back to network
  - Skip waiting and immediate client claim for faster updates

### 2. Web App Manifest (`public/manifest.json`)
- **Name**: "My Agent Follow v0.1" (v0.1 specification as required)
- **Short Name**: "MAF v0.1"
- **Theme Color**: #1e40af (blue theme for v0.1)
- **Icons**: 
  - 192x192px icon for standard displays
  - 512x512px icon for high-resolution displays
  - Both marked as "any maskable" for maximum compatibility

### 3. PWA Icons
- Created placeholder PNG icons at:
  - `public/icons/icon-192.png` (192x192)
  - `public/icons/icon-512.png` (512x512)
- Note: These are placeholder images. For production, replace with actual branded icons.

### 4. HTML Integration (`public/index.html`)
- PWA manifest link reference
- iOS-specific meta tags:
  - `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`: Enables fullscreen mode on iOS
  - `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style`: Black translucent status bar
  - `apple-mobile-web-app-title`: App title for iOS home screen
  - `apple-touch-icon`: Icon for iOS home screen
- Theme color meta tag for browser UI
- Service Worker registration script

### 5. Development Server
- Updated `package.json` to include http-server for serving static files
- Dev script: `npm run dev` now serves the `public` directory on port 3000
- Added http-server as a dev dependency

## Conflict Resolution Rules Applied
As per requirements:
1. ✅ `CACHE = 'maf-cache-v2'` in service-worker.js
2. ✅ manifest.json uses v0.1 name and theme
3. ✅ Both icon sets included (192x192 and 512x512)

## Files Created/Modified
- `public/service-worker.js` (new)
- `public/manifest.json` (new)
- `public/index.html` (new)
- `public/icons/icon-192.png` (new)
- `public/icons/icon-512.png` (new)
- `package.json` (modified - added http-server, updated dev script)
- `README.md` (modified - updated PWA notes)

## Testing
- Local server tested successfully on http://localhost:3000
- Manifest.json serves correctly
- Service worker file is accessible
- Icons are served correctly

## CI/CD Status
- CI workflow requires manual approval before running (action_required status)
- Once approved, the E2E tests should pass with the new PWA test
- The PWA manifest test in `e2e/smoke.spec.ts` should now pass

## Next Steps
1. Request CI approval from repository owner
2. Verify all E2E tests pass
3. Merge to main branch
4. (Optional) Replace placeholder icons with actual branded icons
5. (Optional) Enhance service worker with more sophisticated caching strategies
